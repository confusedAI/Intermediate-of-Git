### My notes for Git and Github

Version control is a system for tracking changes to files. As you modify files, the version control system records and saves each change. This allows you to restore to a previous version of your code at any time.<br/>

Many peopleâ€™s version-control method of choice is to copy different versions of different files into different directories such that each directory has versions for one type of file.<br/>

*So without a version control system, you are stuck manually saving multiple versions of your file using different dates and/or names (e.g. 12-02-2016-monkey\_code.php,12-03-2016-monkey_code.php,etc)*.

**This method is time-consuming,error-prone and impractical when you are dealing with hundreds of files.
Also renaming a file also doesn't give you any context as to what changes were made or who they were made by. When multiple team members edit the same file, overwriting may occur and it becomes difficult to keep up with the latest file version.**<br/>

In the upcoming lessons we'll study about **Git** and **Github**.Git has become the most widely used system for version control and sharing code.
Github is a code sharing and collaboration platform.
